i have already built the frontend,ui and backend using the django

I have already created a scan page , registration page, dashboard and also the django views and model of the system

### Now train the data model and implement in the system.
feature to implement
### 1. Face Recognition-Based Attendance (Live Webcam)
- **Face Detection**: Implement using MTCNN manually.
I have provided data set for face detection:
datasets
       ->face detection
                    ->images
                           train data
                           val data
                    -> labels
                            train data
                            val data

properly train the data for face detection using the given dataset.

- **Face Recognition**: Implement using faceNet. use the pretrained facenet model for face recognition.




implement all this feature in the already build system.

after training the model save all the matrix, outcome and result of the training .

## train the model in such way its validation matrix and confusion matrix should look like image in training matrix demo folder.
